            <p>
                Back to December 31<sup>st</sup>2016, before New Year's eve, I left Vietnam to study in USA for 3 years and returned to Vietnam in 2019.
                I have been working as an <em>IT Help Desk</em> and <abbr title="Single Point Of Contact">SPOC</abbr>. I have done really good in my career as well as my life.
                However, I still decide to leave everything and start again with a new different career so I can do what I really love.
                A lot of people, even my family questioned me: <b>Why do you want to start over?</b>.
            </p>
            <P>
                For me, it is never too late to do what you really want, no matter how hard it could be. I had been through a lot of accidents in my life. 
                I had to leave high school in the middle of the semester because of my health issue, it took me at least 1 year to recover and I had to start again. 
                I fell behind with my friends, but I never give up, and I always try my best to achieve my goals.
            </P>
            <p>
