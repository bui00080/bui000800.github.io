                As one of the largest cities in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City is known by many tourists with a very special name: "the city that never sleeps".
                Most of the tourist services as well as dining and entertainment in the city are only really bustling after 9 pm regardless of the day of the week.
                There are many places such as Bui Vien walking street, which is known as a fun place for foreign tourists.
                If you don't like the hustle and bustle, you can go to the sidewalk cafes, those shops are everywhere, just buy a glass of water and you can sit until the shop closes.
                Most especially, if visitors have difficulty sleeping or time zone difference, they can always find hawker stalls on the sidewalk. A bowl of noodles at 2 a.m. will definitely help you relax and fall asleep easier. 
                What's more, there are many night markets, which usually sell until 5am.
                In addition to nightlife activities, Ho Chi Minh City is also chosen by many food lovers as a destination. 
                In addition to bread, pho, there are many famous breakfast dishes such as sticky rice, broken rice, etc.
